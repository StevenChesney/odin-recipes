    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Heat a barbecue grill or chargrill on high. Use a sharp knife to cut slits in the top of the chicken. Cook on grill for 6 mins each side or until cooked through. Transfer to a plate. Cover with foil and set aside for 5 mins to rest.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Meanwhile, cook bacon in a non-stick frying pan over high heat, turning, for 4-5 mins or until crisp. Transfer to a plate lined with paper towel. Tear into pieces. </li>
        <br>
        <li>To make the Caesar dressing, place the anchovies, if using, egg yolks and garlic in a food processor and process until smooth. With the motor running, gradually add the oil in a thin, steady stream. Add the lemon juice and process until combined. Season.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Thinly slice the chicken. Divide the lettuce, kale, chicken, bacon and soft-boiled egg among serving bowls. Drizzle with dressing. Sprinkle with the parmesan and season to serve.</li>
